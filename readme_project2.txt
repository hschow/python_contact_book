Once the program has been opened the first thing it does it print out the all the contacts from the address book (file: contacts.txt), after all of the contacts have been printed out the user is asked a question. The question the user is asked what they would like to do with the contacts. 
They can add a contact (by typing and enter ‘o’ or ‘add new contact’), display address book, search for a contact, modify a contact, delete a contact or exit the program. 
If the user chooses add a new contact, the program will then ask for the new contacts name, then their address, followed by phone number and lastly email address. 
If the user decides to display address book, then all the contents (all of the contacts) will again be printed. 
If the user chooses to search for a contact, the user will then be asked for the name of the contact they are searching for. If there is a contact with that name the rest of that contacts info will be print (address, phone number, email), if there is no contact matching that name the program will print "There is no contact with that name in your address book". 
If the user choose to modify a contact, the user will be asked which contact to modify. If there is no contact matching the answer again the program will print "There is no contact with that name in your address book", but if there is a contact matching the the input, then the user will be asked what part of the contact to modify. 
The user can choose to modify the name, address, phone number, or email of the contact. Once they have chosen and imputed their option, the program will ask what they will change the contact to say. 
If the user choose to delete a contact the program will ask which contact to delete. Once the user has entered which contact to delete if the contact exists in the address book it will then be deleted, all of it including the name, address, phone number, and email. 
Lastly if the user choose to exit the program then the program will just end.
